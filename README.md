# PlatformEngineeringTask

Unfortunately, AWS wasnt working with me as I didnt have a cerdit card for completing my account. I opted to use Google cloud platfom. I created the project, linked it to my github account but there was errors happening with google cloud services where it wouldnt detect any of my repos. If it had properly been properly linked, my code on git would have been easy to deploy and monitor and it would have just been a matter of testing to make sure all edits can be observed with the pipeline.
